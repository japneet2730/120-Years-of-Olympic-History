# 120-Years-of-Olympic-History
This is a simple Data Science project. The aim is to gain insights and understanding various aspects of the historical Olympic Games dataset. I will perform data cleaning first and then create visualizations. The project also include a few Machine Learning Algorithms.


## About the Project:

This is a Data Science project using the [120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results). We have following objectives with this activity -
  - Get some interesting insights on the data we have available, like say person who won most No. of Golds in Olympic History, No. of Countries participated each year and what not.
  - Learning purpose - Use Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to analyse the data and provide us an interesting use case to apply these skills. Machine Learning Algorithms using Scipy Library to preform predictions, z-score, r2 score, etc.


## Prerequisites

This is about learning Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. One is expected to have Basic Python knowledge and know how to use the Jupyter environment.
Anaconda has be used as the tool to perporm the coding part.
To open the notebook, just run jupyter notebook from the project root directory.


## Visualization

We will also be using Tableau for the Visualization part in the form of Dashboards.
